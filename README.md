#--A.R.S.E--

--AngularJS/RequireJS/SystemJS/es6-module-loader--

The '--''s aren't just for looks, I use the operator-- and the --operator to demonstrate that when you learn to use this package, you'll have less fear of learning these APIs.

###Organization

Each component will be interfaced to each other so any permutation is possible.

Bogart  Pretty. Is it all formatted that way?

Maeoll  Bogart yeah, i'm trying to keep my code good looking. David, can't you see? 
I'm building an http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/arse
arse - Wiktionary
From Old English ærs, ears, from Proto-Germanic *arsaz. Cognate with Dutch aars 
and German Arsch. Ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *órsos (“backside, buttocks”) 
(according to Julius Pokorny and Carl Darling Buck).

Maeoll  --ARSE-- is an angularJS/requireJS/systemJS/es6-module-loader (Javascript 
version 6 compliant asynchronous module definition loader).
Do you wish to know more? [No/Yes]

Maeoll  AngularJS is quickly becoming the de facto standard for SPA (single page
application)because it's two-way databinding but that's limiting to stick to a SPA. 
If you want a complete website you need to make every page made with angular into a 
module and that's where requireJS/systemJS/EML come in. Require uses a tech spec 
called commonJS, which is named it because it's a common module management method, 
but there's a governing body over javascript(ecmascript) that established version 6 
over javascript and commonJS won't exist 10 years from meow. That's where systemJS 
comes in. It's compliant to version 6 and will still be relevant in a decade. 
By making all the components work together I can capitalize its usability and by 
making it public so can everyone else. Maybe it'll get me a job because it shows I
can see future trends in tech. That is, if I can make it work wink emoticon

Maeoll  Also, before I forget the -- before and after are what are called autodecrement 
operators, like doing -1 automatically (why its "auto") and an fat arse means you can't 
move around very nimbly (re: Jada Pinkett Smith in Matrix 3, who exclaims "she's got a 
fat ass!" during a maneuver operation piloting an aircraft), but using this package you
'll have a smaller ARSE because you'll have done both --ARSE and ARSE-- together. So 
your website will be more nimble and can adapt to a wider variety of situations. 
by having a smaller ARSE.
